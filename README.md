# PPWCode.vNext

This repository tracks the work on the next version of the major .NET PPWCode
libraries. The libraries are currently developped in the context of a single
Visual Studio solution and a single git repository to enable drastic
refactorings across the different libraries.

The code can be used directly from Git by including it in your own project using
a git submodule. No NuGet packages are released at this point, not even
prerelease packages. the Git submodule approach is explained further down this
document. Use is at your own risk: be aware that no apis offered by the
libraries should be considered stable at this point.
